      <h1 id = 'about'>About Me</h1>
      <p id = 'about-txt'>My name is Seamus Quinn Oâ€™Malley, and I am a Computer Science Student from Cal Poly (SLO). <br><br>
        First and foremost, I am a learner. No matter what the situation, my ability to learn and solve problems
        presented to me is what I believe makes me stand out. When given a task, I solve it. I go above and beyond
        and create results that exceed expectations and when given a chance at work, I quickly prove this. <br> <br>
        My experience in Computer Science spans throughout the field, and I am ready to take it to the next level
        with real work experience. My experience comes in the form of projects, some of which includes my work
        on a fully functional game built in java, multiple algorithmic based projects in python, and web
        development. I have a very strong foundational knowledge of key topics such as data structures,
        object-oriented programing, and object-c/assembly. I feel the most comfortable with Java and Python,
        but because of my fundamental knowledge of computer science, I believe that I can work in any development
        language, given a small amount of time to get used to syntax. <br><br>
        On top of that, by the end of this year, I plan on taking classes on system programming,
        discrete structures, and data science. I am passionate and motivated to become the best
        software engineer I can, and all I need is an opportunity to prove my talents. I am the
        team member to work towards exceptionalism, not just someone who is fine with the statis quo.
